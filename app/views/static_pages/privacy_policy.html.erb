        Privacy Policy:<br><br>
            Taiwanforall.org is a website created specifically in order to petition the WHO to allow Taiwan to participate in its activities. The website is set up and run by volunteers and is not attached to or owned by any state, association or other organization. 
            In order to administer and submit the petition to the WHO, it is necessary to collect the personal data of the people who sign it. The goal of this privacy policy is to explain who has access to your personal data and how and why it is processed.
        <br><br><br>
        Data controller:<br><br>
            In France, all personal data collected via the website is processed and stored under the responsibility of Mr. Jean-Marc Dardy. Mr. Dardy is thus the data controller of the personal data in this context and can be contacted at taiwanforall@protonmail.com.

                Because it relates to your political opinions, your support for the petition constitutes sensitive personal data and benefits from extra legal protections. Your specific consent to the processing of your personal data in this context is therefore requested.

They will then be communicated to the Director General of the World Health Organisation. Your name, family name, profession and country will be used to demonstrate the number of signatures.
                The purpose of collecting your personal data via the webform is to enable the establishment and communication of the petition to the WHO. The legal basis for the processing is your consent, which you are asked to provide using a checkbox when you submit the webform.

                You can withdraw your consent at any time by writing to taiwanforall@protonmail.com. If you withdraw your consent, your personal data will be deleted and your name will not be included in the petition submitted to the WHO.
