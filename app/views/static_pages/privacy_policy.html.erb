        <h2>Privacy Policy:</h2><br><br>
            House-of-coin.com  is a website created specifically in order to petition the WHO to allow Taiwan to participate in its activities. The website is set up and run by volunteers and is not attached to or owned by any state, association or other organization. 
            In order to administer and submit the petition to the WHO, it is necessary to collect the personal data of the people who sign it. The goal of this privacy policy is to explain who has access to your personal data and how and why it is processed.
